				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="images/wiseguys3-596.jpg" width="596" height="447" alt="" /></p>
					<p><strong>Wise Guys</strong> is your local Gents' barbers.  In business since 2001, and located at the junction of Southdown Road and Piggottshill Lane, in Southdown, Harpenden, we offer a friendly, professional haircutting service.</P>
					<hr>					
					<p><h3><strong>COVID-19 SERVICE UPDATE from Mark</strong></h3></p>
					<p>Due to Covid-19 WiseGuys will be making some SERIOUS changes to ensure EVERYONE is safe!</p>
					<strong><ul><li>My Barbershop is a very unique and safe environment, as your booking hires out me and my shop exclusively for your haircut. 
					<li>Temperature check before you walk in. 
					<li>Sanitisation of all equipment between each booking</ul></strong>
<p>During the prior lockdown I have completed a deep clean of the shop, and this will continue as I reopen – allowing time between customers to wipe down all surfaces as well as disinfect tools between customers.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will be making the following fundamental changes:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.fresha.com/providers/wiseguys-pg1sfz0c?pId=346827" target="_blank">Online bookings (appointments only)</a></li>
<li>Card payment only (no cash)</li></ul>
<p>I will only be taking online bookings from now on, this will ensure there is time allocated to limit one customer in the shop at a time and to complete the deep clean between customers.</p>
<p>I will also no longer be accepting cash as payment due to the potential risks, and am pleased to say all debit and credit cards will now be accepted!</p>
<p>Under the new Government guidelines hairdressers should be open by 4th July.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support in this matter – let’s hope I can fix all the home family butchered haircuts; which I am sure you have all had!!</p>
<p>Re-opening 4th of July so please book your appointment online now to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p><i>Take Care, Mark</i></p>
